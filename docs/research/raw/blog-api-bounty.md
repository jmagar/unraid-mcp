Introducing the Unraid API Feature Bounty Program
=================================================

We’re opening new doors for developers and power users to directly shape the Unraid experience, together.

The new [Unraid API](https://docs.unraid.net/API/)
 has already come a long way as a powerful, open-source toolkit that unlocks endless possibilities for automation, integrations, and third-party applications. With each release, we’ve seen the creativity of our community take center stage, building tools that extend the Unraid experience in ways we never imagined.

Now, we’re taking it one step further with the [**Unraid API Feature Bounty Program**.](https://unraid.net/feature-bounty)

### **What Is the Feature Bounty Program?**

The bounty program gives developers (and adventurous users) a way to directly contribute to the Unraid API roadmap. Here’s how it works:

1.  **Feature Requests Become Bounties:** We post specific API features that would benefit the entire Unraid ecosystem.
2.  **You Build & Contribute:** Developers who implement these features can claim the bounty, earn recognition, and a monetary reward.
3.  **Community Driven Growth:** Instead of waiting for features to arrive, you can help build them, get rewarded, and help the Unraid community.

Our core team focuses on high-priority roadmap items. Bounties give the community a way to help accelerate other highly requested features by bringing more ideas to life, faster, with recognition and reward for those who contribute.

### **The Open-Source Unraid API**

Alongside the bounty program, we’re thrilled to highlight just how open and flexible the Unraid API has become. Whether you’re scripting via the CLI, building automations with the API, or integrating with external identity providers through OAuth2/OIDC, the API is designed to be transparent and extensible.
