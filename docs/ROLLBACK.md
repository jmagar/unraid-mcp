# Rollback / Yank Runbook -- unraid-mcp

What to do when a bad release ships. Merging the release-please PR fires a chain:

1. **PyPI publish** -- `publish-pypi.yml` on the GitHub Release (`release: published`).
2. **Docker publish** -- `docker-publish.yml` on the `v*` tag push.
3. **MCP Registry publish** -- `mcp-publisher publish` runs inside `publish-pypi.yml`
   after the PyPI step, using the version stamped into `server.json` from the tag.

The published tool surface includes **destructive Unraid actions** (`array stop_array`,
`array remove_disk`, `docker remove_container`, `vm force_stop`, `key delete`, ...). A bad
release has real blast radius, so treat rollback as an incident, not housekeeping.

> **First rule of releases:** versions are immutable. You cannot un-publish and re-use a
> version number on any of the three channels. Recovery is always **yank/re-pin the bad
> version + ship a forward-fix patch**, never "re-upload the same version with the fix."

## 1. PyPI -- yank + forward-fix

PyPI does **not** allow re-uploading files for a version, even after you delete or yank it.
You cannot "fix `X.Y.Z` in place." Recovery is two independent actions:

**Yank the bad version** (hides it from new resolves; existing pins that request it exactly
still install it, so in-flight deployments don't break):

```bash
# Via twine (preferred, scriptable)
uv run twine yank unraid-mcp X.Y.Z --reason "broken release: <short reason>"

# Or via the web UI: pypi.org/manage/project/unraid-mcp/release/X.Y.Z/ -> "Yank"
```

**Ship a forward-fix patch.** release-please makes this fast -- land a `fix:` commit on
`main`, merge the release PR it opens, and the chain republishes a clean `X.Y.(Z+1)`:

```bash
git commit -m "fix: <what was broken in X.Y.Z>"
# push -> merge the release-please PR -> publish-pypi.yml ships X.Y.(Z+1)
```

Tell consumers to upgrade (`uvx unraid-mcp-server@X.Y.(Z+1)`, `uv add unraid-mcp@>=X.Y.(Z+1)`).
Yanking alone does not move anyone forward; the patch is what fixes them.

---

## 2. Docker -- re-pin to a prior immutable tag/digest

The GHCR image is at `ghcr.io/<owner>/unraid-mcp`. You cannot delete a tag and expect
consumers to recover -- you tell them to **re-pin to a known-good prior image by digest**.

`docker/metadata-action` tags every build addressably, so a prior good build is always
reachable even if the moving tags (`latest`, `X`, `X.Y`) now point at the bad release:

- `type=semver` -> `X.Y.Z`, `X.Y`, `X` (immutable version tags)
- `type=sha` -> `sha-<commit>` (immutable per-commit tag)
- every build is also addressable by `@sha256:<digest>`

**Recovery -- pin consumers to the prior digest:**

```bash
# Find the last-good version's digest (use the prior X.Y.Z tag)
docker buildx imagetools inspect ghcr.io/<owner>/unraid-mcp:<prior-version>
# -> copy the Digest: sha256:... line

# Pin deployments to that immutable digest (compose / run)
image: ghcr.io/<owner>/unraid-mcp@sha256:<prior-digest>
```

Pinning by `@sha256:...` (not a moving tag) guarantees the rolled-back deploy can't drift
back onto the bad image. Then ship the forward-fix patch (section 1) so `latest`/`X.Y` move
to a clean build, and consumers can return to tag-based pins.

To list available tags/digests when you don't know the prior version:

```bash
gh api /users/<owner>/packages/container/unraid-mcp/versions \
  --jq '.[] | {tags: .metadata.container.tags, created: .created_at}'
```

---

## 3. MCP Registry -- republish the prior version

The registry entry is driven by `server.json`, whose version is stamped from the git tag at
publish time. Recovery is the same forward pattern: **republish the last-good version**, then
let the forward-fix patch publish a clean newer one.

```bash
# Re-stamp server.json to the known-good prior version and republish
jq --arg v "<prior-version>" '
  .version = $v |
  .packages = [.packages[] | if .registryType == "pypi" then .version = $v else . end]
' server.json > server.tmp && mv server.tmp server.json

./mcp-publisher login dns --domain tootie.tv --private-key "$MCP_PRIVATE_KEY"
./mcp-publisher publish
```

In normal operation `server.json` is a `0.0.0` placeholder in-repo and is set from the tag by
`publish-pypi.yml` -- only stamp it by hand for an out-of-band rollback republish. The forward-
fix patch will publish the clean `X.Y.(Z+1)` through the normal chain.

## Prevention

These guards exist to catch a bad release before (or just after) it ships -- keep them green:

- **Version-sync guard.** Both `publish-pypi.yml` and `docker-publish.yml` assert the git tag
  matches `pyproject.toml` before publishing, so a tag<->source drift fails the build instead
  of shipping a mismatched version. `ci.yml`'s version-sync job checks the manifests on PRs.
- **Trivy scan (advisory).** `docker-publish.yml` runs Trivy on the built image and uploads
  SARIF to GitHub Security. It is **advisory** -- it surfaces CRITICAL/HIGH CVEs but does not
  block the publish. Review the Security tab after a release; a flagged image is a candidate
  for a forward-fix rebuild.
- **Don't hand-edit versions.** Let release-please own the bump (see `docs/PUBLISHING.md` and
  `docs/CHECKLIST.md`). Forward-fixing via a `fix:` commit is the supported fast path back to a
  clean release.
