"""Consolidated per-subscription state for the SubscriptionManager.

Historically the manager spread each subscription's state across ~8 parallel
dicts keyed by name (``active_subscriptions``, ``reconnect_attempts``,
``connection_states``, ``last_error``, ``_connection_start_times``,
``_last_graphql_error``, ``_graphql_error_count``, ``resource_data``). Keeping
them in sync was an unstated invariant. This module collapses all of them into a
single :class:`SubscriptionState` dataclass, with one instance per subscription
name held in ``SubscriptionManager.states``. That makes the
"single-writer-per-name" invariant structural: there is exactly one object per
name and every field lives on it.

To keep the manager's historical attribute surface (``mgr.connection_states``,
``mgr.last_error``, ...) — which external callers and the test-suite read and
write directly — those attributes are now :class:`_StateFieldView` mappings.
Each view is a thin ``MutableMapping`` that reads and writes a *single field* of
the underlying :class:`SubscriptionState` objects, auto-creating a state entry on
write. The consolidated ``states`` dict is the one source of truth; the views are
field-projections over it, not independent storage.

    ``connection_start_time`` and the graphql-error-dedup fields) are guarded by
    the manager's ``_task_lock``; ``data`` is guarded by ``_data_lock``.

    """A ``MutableMapping`` projecting one field of every ``SubscriptionState``.

    Transitional backward-compat shim: the manager still *writes* through these
    views (e.g. ``mgr.connection_states[name] = "active"``), so the
    single-writer-per-name invariant is not yet structural. A future change
    should migrate the manager's writes to ``self.states[name].<field>`` directly
    and make these views read-only projections; until then they remain writable.

    Backed by the manager's consolidated ``states`` dict — never its own storage.
    Reading ``view[name]`` returns ``getattr(states[name], field)``; writing
    ``view[name] = value`` sets that field, auto-creating a ``SubscriptionState``
    when the name is new (mirroring the old defaultdict-style ``dict[name] = v``
    behavior). This lets ``mgr.connection_states[name] = "active"`` and friends
    keep working while ``states`` remains the single source of truth.

    Iteration/membership only surface names whose field is *not* at its declared
    default, so the view reads like the original sparse dict (a name with a
    default-valued field reads as "absent") — matching the historical
    ``dict.get(name, <fallback>)`` access pattern used throughout the manager.

    Absent-detection rule: when the field default is ``None`` the check is
    identity (``value is None``), which is safe for object-valued fields such as
    ``task`` and ``data`` (``MagicMock() == None`` returns a truthy mock, so an
    equality check there would misbehave). For non-``None`` defaults (``""``,
    ``0``) the values are always simple scalars, so equality is used.
