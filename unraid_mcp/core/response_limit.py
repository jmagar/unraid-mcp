"""Structured response-size limiting middleware.

fastmcp's stock ``ResponseLimitingMiddleware`` joins all text blocks and hard-cuts
the UTF-8 byte string mid-content, then appends a plain-text suffix. The ``unraid``
tool returns its payload as a JSON string in a single text block, so a mid-string
cut yields **invalid JSON** with no structured signal telling the agent to narrow
its query.

This middleware keeps the same trigger semantics (replace the result when its
serialized size exceeds ``max_size``) but, instead of salvaging a partial JSON
slice, returns a clean, complete, valid JSON marker the agent can parse:

    {
        "error": "response_truncated",
        "truncated": true,
        "original_bytes": <n>,
        "limit_bytes": <cap>,
        "hint": "Response exceeded the size limit. Narrow the query: ..."
    }

        The ``unraid`` tool's payload is a JSON string in a single ``TextContent``
        block — by far the common case. For that shape we measure the text bytes
        directly instead of re-serializing the whole ``ToolResult`` via
        ``pydantic_core.to_json`` on every call. The full serialization is only
        marginally larger (the content wrapper plus JSON escaping of the text — and
        escaping can add more than a wrapper's worth of bytes for quote/backslash-
        heavy content), so the fast path under-counts and is therefore conservative:
        it never truncates a response that full serialization would have kept under
        the cap.

        For multi-block results we avoid serializing an over-cap payload in full
        just to reject it. The raw text bytes of all ``TextContent`` blocks are a
        strict lower bound on the full ``to_json`` size (which adds the content
        wrapper plus JSON escaping, both non-negative). So if that running sum alone
        already exceeds ``max_size``, full serialization would too — we return the
        partial sum early (still ``> max_size``, preserving the exact over-cap
        decision) without serializing the rest. Only when the text bytes stay within
        the cap — or the result carries genuinely opaque (non-text) blocks — do we
        fall back to the full ``pydantic_core.to_json`` measurement.
