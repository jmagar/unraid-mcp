    Re-raises ToolError as-is. Converts CredentialsNotConfiguredError to a ToolError
    with setup instructions including CREDENTIALS_ENV_PATH; does not log.
    Gives TimeoutError a descriptive message. Catches all other exceptions,
    logs them with full traceback, and wraps them in ToolError.

    Remaining exceptions are split into two user-facing classes — without leaking
    any internal specifics — so the agent can decide whether retrying is worthwhile:

    * *likely-server-bug* types (``KeyError``, ``AttributeError``, ``TypeError``,
      ``IndexError``, ``NameError``) surface as an "internal error (likely a bug)"
      message, signalling that retrying the same call will not help.
    * everything else (network/IO/upstream errors) surfaces as an
      "upstream/network error" message, which is worth a retry.

    Both classes are logged in full via ``logger.exception``.

    Args:
        tool_name: The tool name for error messages (e.g., "docker", "vm").
        action: The current action being executed.
        logger: The logger instance to use for error logging.
