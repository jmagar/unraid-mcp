"""Tests for the FastMCP lifespan shutdown wiring in unraid_mcp.server.

The server's ``lifespan`` async context manager runs shutdown cleanup
(``subscription_manager.stop_all()`` + ``close_http_client()``) IN the server's
own event loop on every transport and exit path (normal return, SIGTERM,
KeyboardInterrupt). These tests enter and exit that context manager with both
cleanup callables mocked and assert each is awaited exactly once on shutdown.

Patch target: the cleanup names are imported into the ``unraid_mcp.server``
module namespace and resolved there at call time, so patch on
``unraid_mcp.server.*`` (not the core modules).
