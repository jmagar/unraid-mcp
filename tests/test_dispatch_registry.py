"""Guard the dispatcher refactor: action-registry completeness + UnraidInput contract.

The consolidated `unraid` tool was refactored to pack its flat keyword args into
an internal `UnraidInput` model and route through the `_ACTION_DISPATCH` registry.
Two invariants must hold or the refactor silently degrades:

1. **Registry completeness.** Every action in `UNRAID_ACTIONS` must be reachable —
   either via `_ACTION_DISPATCH` or handled inline (`help`). A future action added
   to the Literal + tool signature but forgotten in the registry would route to the
   uniform "Invalid action" `ToolError` with no test failing.
2. **`UnraidInput` behavior.** `action` is typed `str` (not the Literal) so an
   invalid action falls through to the registry's uniform `ToolError` instead of a
   pydantic `ValidationError` (preserving the documented contract); and
   `extra="forbid"` rejects unknown fields (keeping the model in lockstep with the
   tool signature).
